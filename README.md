# Statistical Auditing Animations

This repository contains mathematical animations illustrating concepts in statistical auditing made using [manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), which is an animation engine for explanatory math videos.

### Rendering

To render the videos on your own computer, make sure that you have a working version of `manim`. See [this page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) for install instructions.

If you have a working setup, open a terminal in the project folder and type the following command. This will render the scene using low quality (`-ql`) and will preview it when it is done (`-p`). The videos will have to be rendered locally because they are too large to put in an online repository.

```
manim -ql -p scene.py
```
