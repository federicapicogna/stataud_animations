# Statistical Auditing Animations

This repository contains mathematical animations illustrating concepts in statistical auditing made using [manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), which is an animation engine for explanatory math videos.

### Rendering

To render the clips on your own pc, make sure that you have a working version of `manim`. See [this page](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) for install instructions. If you have a working setup, open a terminal in the project folder and type the following command.

```
manim -pql scene.py
```
